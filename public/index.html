        <h1 id="Gamblers-more-likely-to-have-co-existing-mental-disorders"><a href="#Gamblers-more-likely-to-have-co-existing-mental-disorders" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers more likely to have co-existing mental disorders"></a>Gamblers more likely to have co-existing mental disorders</h1><p>Gambling disorder is characterised by persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behaviour. Problematic gambling behaviour is defined as gambling that causes harm or distress, including but not limited to, problems with financial stability, work, social life, mental health, and physical health.</p>
<p>Up to two-thirds of people with a gambling disorder also have a co-existing mental disorder. The most common co-existing mental disorders are mood disorders (e.g. depression), anxiety disorders (e.g. panic disorder), and substance use disorders (alcohol or drug abuse&#x2F;addiction). Personality disorders are also common in people with gambling disorder.</p>
<p>People with a gambling disorder are more likely to experience psychiatric hospitalisations, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and criminal activity than people without a gambling disorder.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder can be treated with cognitive-behavioural therapy or medication. Treatment can help people stop or reduce their problematic gambling behaviour and improve their mental health symptoms.</p>
<h1 id="Chumash-Casino-offers-help-for-those-with-gambling-and-comorbid-disorders"><a href="#Chumash-Casino-offers-help-for-those-with-gambling-and-comorbid-disorders" class="headerlink" title="Chumash Casino offers help for those with gambling and comorbid disorders"></a>Chumash Casino offers help for those with gambling and comorbid disorders</h1><p>Chumash Casino Resort, in Santa Barbara County, California, is partnering with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) to provide resources for those who suffer from problem gambling and other comorbid disorders. The NCPG is a national organization that provides education and resources for those with problem gambling and other comorbid disorders.</p>
<p>According to the Chumash Casino website, “Chumash Casino Resort is proud to offer our guests access to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) helpline. This toll-free service is available to any guest who is concerned about their gambling behavior or that of a loved one. The NCPG helpline offers 24&#x2F;7 support from certified problem gambling counselors.”</p>
<p>In addition to providing access to the NCPG helpline, Chumash Casino Resort offers a variety of resources on its website that can help those with problem gambling and other comorbid disorders. These resources include a self-assessment quiz to help individuals identify whether they have a problem with gambling, information about the signs and symptoms of problem gambling, and tips for how to get help.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of information available about the different types of comorbid disorders that often occur together with problem gambling, such as anxiety disorders, depression, and alcohol or drug addiction. In addition, there are links to helpful resources for each of these comorbid disorders.</p>
<p>For individuals who are struggling with problem gambling and another comorbid disorder, Chumash Casino Resort can be a valuable resource for getting help. The NCPG helpline provides support around the clock from certified counselors, and the website offers information and resources on many different aspects of problem gambling and other comorbid disorders.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-may-be-linked-to-other-mental-health-conditions"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-may-be-linked-to-other-mental-health-conditions" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction may be linked to other mental health conditions"></a>Gambling addiction may be linked to other mental health conditions</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem. It can have a devastating impact on people’s lives, both financially and mentally. New research has found that gambling addiction may be linked to other mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>People with gambling addiction are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety than those without an addiction. This is because gambling addiction can be very isolating. People who are addicted to gambling often feel like they can’t talk to anyone about their problem, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>Depression and anxiety can also be caused by gambling addiction because of the financial stress that it can cause. Financial stress is one of the main causes of depression and anxiety. When someone is struggling with debt or money problems, it can lead to a lot of emotional stress. This stress can then cause symptoms of depression or anxiety.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available for people with gambling addiction, including therapy and support groups. It is important to get help if you are struggling with this type of addiction, as it can have a negative impact on your life.</p>
<h1 id="Comorbid-disorders-often-go-hand-in-hand-with-problem-gambling"><a href="#Comorbid-disorders-often-go-hand-in-hand-with-problem-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Comorbid disorders often go hand in hand with problem gambling"></a>Comorbid disorders often go hand in hand with problem gambling</h1><p>Problem gambling is a serious mental health condition that can have severe consequences for the individual and their loved ones. However, it is often comorbid with other mental health disorders, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Some of the most common comorbid disorders include mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.</p>
<p>People with problem gambling are twice as likely to suffer from a mood disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder, and three times as likely to have an anxiety disorder. In fact, problem gambling can be considered an early warning sign for developing a more serious mental illness. This is why it is so important to seek treatment for problem gambling if you or someone you know is struggling with it.</p>
<p>Substance use disorders are also common in people with problem gambling. Studies have found that up to 60% of people with problem gambling also have a substance use disorder. This may be due to the fact that people with problem gambling are often looking for ways to cope with their emotional pain. Alcohol and drugs can provide short-term relief, but they ultimately only make the problems worse.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any of these comorbid disorders along with your problem gambling, it is important to seek out specialist help. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating comorbid conditions, so it is important to find a treatment plan that works for you. With the right treatment, you can overcome all of your challenges and start living a healthier life.</p>

        <h1 id="Taxman-cometh-for-Sin-City’s-gambling-winnings"><a href="#Taxman-cometh-for-Sin-City’s-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Taxman cometh for Sin City’s gambling winnings"></a>Taxman cometh for Sin City’s gambling winnings</h1><p>After years of gambling in Las Vegas, Nevada lawmakers have decided it’s time for their cut. Gambling winnings in the city will now be subject to state taxes, starting at 8%.</p>
<p>This new tax comes as a bit of a shock to casino-goers, as Nevada was one of only a handful of states that didn’t tax gambling winnings. But with the state’s budget in shambles, lawmakers are looking for any way to bring in more revenue.</p>
<p>The 8% tax will apply not just to casino jackpots, but also to money won from poker or blackjack tables, slot machines, and race track betting. It will also apply to winnings from out-of-state casinos, even if the gambler is not a resident of Nevada.</p>
<p>The new tax is expected to generate about $60 million per year for the state coffers. In addition to the 8% tax, there is also a federal income tax on gambling winnings, which can be as high as 39.6%.</p>
<p>Casino operators in Las Vegas are not happy about the new tax. They say it will drive customers to other destinations such as Atlantic City or Monte Carlo. They are also concerned about the impact on tourism, which accounts for more than one-third of Nevada’s economy.</p>
<p>But some observers say that the days of free rides for Sin City’s casinos may be coming to an end. The city has been relying too much on its gaming revenues, and officials are now looking for ways to shore up its budget.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-casinos-to-withhold-income-taxes-on-gambling-winnings"><a href="#Nevada-casinos-to-withhold-income-taxes-on-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Nevada casinos to withhold income taxes on gambling winnings"></a>Nevada casinos to withhold income taxes on gambling winnings</h1><p>In a unanimous decision on Wednesday, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that casinos may withhold state income taxes from gambling winnings. The ruling overturned a lower court’s decision from 2014 that said the withholding was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The state’s high court justices ruled that the Nevada Constitution’s “abatement of taxes” clause applied only to property taxes and not to income taxes. Justice Michael Cherry, who authored the opinion, said the state Legislature has “the authority to enact laws imposing a tax on income derived from gambling.”</p>
<p>The decision could have wide-reaching implications for the state’s nearly $1 billion casino industry, as well as its nearly $8 billion in annual taxable gambling revenue. Under the ruling, casinos will now be allowed to withhold 3 percent of gambling winnings in order to cover state income taxes.</p>
<p>Gov. Brian Sandoval praised the ruling, saying it would provide “much-needed revenue” for Nevada’s schools and other essential services. “Today’s decision by the Nevada Supreme Court is a victory for our students and for all Nevadans,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Opponents of the withholding policy argue that it amounts to an unconstitutional taking of property without due process. They also claim that it unfairly targets low-income gamblers, who are more likely to have their winnings confiscated by casinos.</p>
<p>But supporters say the withholding policy is necessary to ensure that Nevada’s taxpayers are fairly compensated for losses suffered by casinos. They also note that players can avoid paying taxes on their winnings by filing a tax return in advance and claiming a credit for any withheld amount.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-winnings-will-now-be-taxed-in-Nevada"><a href="#Gambling-winnings-will-now-be-taxed-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="Gambling winnings will now be taxed in Nevada"></a>Gambling winnings will now be taxed in Nevada</h1><p>Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada signed a bill into law this week that will impose a tax on gambling winnings. The new law, which goes into effect on January 1st, 2019, will levy a tax of 6.75% on all winnings above $5,000.</p>
<p>This tax is in addition to the income tax that Nevada residents already pay on their gambling winnings. Governor Sandoval said that the new tax is necessary in order to help pay for important state programs, such as education and healthcare.</p>
<p>Opponents of the new law say that it will drive gamblers away from Nevada casinos and to casinos in other states. They argue that this will cost the state millions of dollars in revenue and lead to job losses in the casino industry.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval dismissed these concerns, saying that the state has “the most competitive gaming environment in the country” and that people will continue to gamble in Nevada even with the new tax. He added that the new law is fair because it applies to all forms of gambling, not just casino games.</p>
<p>What do you think about Nevada’s new gambling tax? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
<h1 id="Winners-at-Las-Vegas-casinos-to-have-tax-withheld"><a href="#Winners-at-Las-Vegas-casinos-to-have-tax-withheld" class="headerlink" title="Winners at Las Vegas casinos to have tax withheld"></a>Winners at Las Vegas casinos to have tax withheld</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced that it will require casinos in Las Vegas to withhold a percentage of gambling winnings for federal income tax purposes. The new rule, which is effective on January 1, 2019, will require casinos to withhold 24 percent of winnings above $5,000 for individuals and 28 percent for corporations.</p>
<p>“This change ensures that the tax obligation on gambling winnings is appropriately administered,” said IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig in a statement. “It also helps to ensure that taxpayers report their gambling income accurately.”</p>
<p>The withholding requirement will apply to all casino games, including slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and craps. It does not apply to lotteries or horse races. Winnings from bingo or keno are also not subject to withholding.</p>
<p>Individuals who have gaming winnings of more than $1,200 in a year are already required to report those winnings on their federal income tax return. The new withholding rule will increase the amount of information reported by casinos to the IRS and should make it easier for the agency to enforce taxes on gambling income.</p>
<h1 id="Sin-City-casinos-to-start-withholding-taxes-on-gambling-winnings"><a href="#Sin-City-casinos-to-start-withholding-taxes-on-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Sin City casinos to start withholding taxes on gambling winnings"></a>Sin City casinos to start withholding taxes on gambling winnings</h1><p>Due to a recent change in Nevada law, casinos in Sin City will now start withholding taxes on gambling winnings. The new law requires casinos to withhold 6.75% of all gambling winnings for state and federal taxes.</p>
<p>The change in the law was made in an effort to help the state budget, which has been struggling in recent years. Governor Brian Sandoval said that the change would bring in an additional $7 million in revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Casino officials said that they are hopeful that the new law will not dissuade people from gambling in Nevada. They added that the withholding amounts are generally not withheld on casino winnings over $5,000.</p>
<p>The change in the law comes as a bit of a surprise, as Nevada is often considered to be a tax-free haven for gambling winnings. In fact, many other states have laws that specifically exempt gambling winnings from taxation.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear whether or not the new law will survive a legal challenge. There is already some discussion among legal experts about whether or not the new law violates the Constitution’s prohibition against double taxation.</p>

This includes both land-based and online gambling. In fact, Nevada was the first state to legalize fully online gambling in 2013.</p>
<p>This commitment to gaming is evident in the state’s revenue from legal gambling. In 2017, Nevada raked in over $1.3 billion from gambling taxes and fees. This accounted for about 11% of the state’s total revenue. It is clear that legalized gambling is a key part of Nevada’s economy.</p>
<p>The success of online gambling in Nevada is largely due to the tight regulations that are in place. The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) oversees all aspects of gaming in the state, including online poker rooms and casinos. This ensures that players are protected and that the games are fair.</p>
<p>The NGCB also requires operators to have a physical presence in Nevada. This prevents offshore operators from taking advantage of Nevadans and helps ensure that all online gambling is legal and regulated.</p>
<p>Nevada’s strong regulations have helped make it the top market for online gambling in the United States. In fact, nearly 60% of all American online poker players are located in Nevada. This gives Nevada a significant advantage over other states when it comes to attracting online gamblers.</p>
<p>The success of online gambling in Nevada has also led to increased investment in the industry. Over the past few years, several new casino resorts have opened in Las Vegas, including Wynn Palace and The Park MGM Resort. These casinos offer high-quality experiences with top-notch amenities, helping to cement Las Vegas’s status as a global gaming destination.</p>
<p>Overall, Nevada has been very successful with its legalized online gambling industry. The tight regulations and strong commitment to gaming have made it a top market for players around the world. And with new casino resorts opening up all the time, there’s no sign of this trend slowing down anytime soon!</p>

If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed after a gambling loss, here are a few tips for moving on.</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept that you made a mistake and move on</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be easy to dwell on your losses, but doing so will only cripple your ability to move on. Accept that you made a mistake and forgive yourself. Then, focus on learning from your experience and making better decisions in the future.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t beat yourself up over wasted money</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s natural to feel upset after spending money on something you can’t afford, but don’t let that guilt dictate your future behavior. Remember that everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and it’s important to learn from them and move forward.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set reasonable goals for yourself</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re trying to recoup your losses overnight, you’re likely to become frustrated and disappointed very quickly. It’s important to set reasonable goals for yourself and give yourself time to achieve them. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither will your financial stability be restored overnight.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Limit your gambling activity</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find that you’re unable to control your spending habits when gambling, it might be best to reduce or even eliminate your activity altogether. Gambling should be enjoyable, not stressful, so if it’s starting to have a negative impact on your life, it’s time to step back.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Seek professional help if necessary</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re struggling with an addiction to gambling, it’s important to seek professional help. There is no shame in admitting that you need help, and there are many resources available for those who are ready to take the next step.</p>
<h1 id="Recovering-from-a-gambling-loss"><a href="#Recovering-from-a-gambling-loss" class="headerlink" title="Recovering from a gambling loss"></a>Recovering from a gambling loss</h1><p>Gambling is a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be costly. If you’ve recently lost money gambling, don’t worry – you can take steps to recover from your loss.</p>
<p>First, be honest with yourself. Don’t try to rationalize your gambling loss by telling yourself that you could have won if you’d only played a little longer or if the cards had fallen your way. Accept that you lost money and move on.</p>
<p>Second, make a plan for how you’re going to get your finances back on track. This may include creating a budget, cutting back on expenses, or finding new sources of income.</p>
<p>Third, don’t try to cover up your gambling loss. Telling friends and family about your loss can be tough, but it’s important to be transparent and honest about what happened. This will help you get the support you need as you work through this difficult time.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t give up. Recovery from a gambling loss takes time and effort, but it is possible. Stay focused on your goals and keep working towards them one step at a time. You can do it!</p>

They can affect our mood, judgement, and daily life. However, there are ways that we can work on forgetting about them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Talk to someone about it: Sharing our gambling experiences with others can help us to process them better. It also allows us to get helpful feedback and advice from others. Talking openly and honestly about our losses can also help us feel supported by others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write down our thoughts and feelings: Putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper can be helpful in terms of understanding them better. This can then allow us to work on addressing them in a more effective way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a plan for how to avoid future losses: After taking some time to reflect on our losses, we can then start making a plan for how to avoid them in the future. This may involve things such as setting financial limits, avoiding certain casinos or games, or calling a friend for support when needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take care of ourselves: In times of distress, it is important that we take care of ourselves both physically and emotionally. This may involve things such as eating healthy food, getting enough sleep,and spending time with positive people who support us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remember that everyone makes mistakes: We are all human and therefore prone to making mistakes from time to time. Accepting this fact can help us move on from our gambling losses more easily.</p>

<h1 id="What-to-do-after-a-gambling-loss"><a href="#What-to-do-after-a-gambling-loss" class="headerlink" title="What to do after a gambling loss"></a>What to do after a gambling loss</h1><p>In the aftermath of a gambling loss, it can be difficult to know what to do next. Whether you’ve lost money or just your stake, there are key steps you should follow to minimize the damage and get back on track. Here are four tips for recovering from a gambling loss:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a break</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve just lost your last bet, it might be tempting to try and win it back right away. However, this is usually not the best course of action. Instead, take a break from gambling altogether and give yourself some time to cool off. This will help you clear your head and come up with a new strategy.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Analyze your losses</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve calmed down, it’s time to take a closer look at why you lost. What were the factors that led to your defeat? Did you make any bad bets? Did you get carried away and bet more than you could afford? It’s important to identify the root causes of your losses so you can avoid them in future.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set realistic goals</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of why you lost, it’s time to set some realistic goals for yourself. Don’t aim too high – start with manageable targets that you’re confident you can achieve. This will help boost your confidence and give you the motivation to continue gambling responsibly.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Seek professional help</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel like you’re struggling to control your gambling habits, it might be time to seek professional help. There are many organizations out there that offer support and guidance for people with gambling problems. Talking to someone who understands what you’re going through can be incredibly helpful in getting your life back on track</p>
<h1 id="How-to-handle-a-gambling-loss"><a href="#How-to-handle-a-gambling-loss" class="headerlink" title="How to handle a gambling loss"></a>How to handle a gambling loss</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be dangerous. Many people don’t realize just how risky gambling can be, and they lose a lot of money as a result. If you’ve recently lost money while gambling, here are some tips for dealing with the loss:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t beat yourself up over it</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s natural to feel guilty or ashamed after losing money while gambling, but remember that you’re not the only one who has ever made this mistake. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, so don’t dwell on your loss.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Acknowledge that you made a mistake</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to accept responsibility for your losses and learn from them. If you continue to gamble after losing money, you’re likely to make the same mistake again. Make a plan to avoid future losses by gambling responsibly.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Talk to someone about it</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel like you can’t cope with your loss on your own, talk to someone about it. Friends or family members will be more than happy to offer support and advice. You may also want to consider talking to a therapist or counsellor if the loss has had a significant impact on your life.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Seek help from Gamblers Anonymous</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think you may have a problem with gambling, Gamblers Anonymous is a good place to start. This organization provides support and resources for people who are struggling with gambling addiction.</p>

And more importantly, can you learn their secrets and start winning too?</p>

<h1 id="1-Pick-the-right-games"><a href="#1-Pick-the-right-games" class="headerlink" title="1: Pick the right games"></a>1: Pick the right games</h1><p>The first thing you need to do if you want to start winning at online casino slots is to pick the right games. Not all slots are created equal, and some games offer better odds than others. So make sure you do your research before you start playing, and try to find games that offer the best odds for players.</p>
<h1 id="2-Play-for-fun"><a href="#2-Play-for-fun" class="headerlink" title="2: Play for fun"></a>2: Play for fun</h1><p>One of the biggest mistakes that new players make is playing for money instead of playing for fun.

<h1 id="3-Set-sensible-limits"><a href="#3-Set-sensible-limits" class="headerlink" title="3: Set sensible limits"></a>3: Set sensible limits</h1><p>It’s important to set sensible limits when gambling, both in terms of the amount of money you’re willing to lose and the amount of time you want to spend playing.

Tips to score big at online roulette tables.4. How to make money with online poker tournaments.5. How to beat the odds at internet casinos</h1><p>At some point in time, everyone who gambles online has either asked themselves or been asked by a friend: which is the best casino? The answer to this question is subjective, as individual preferences will vary. However, there are a few general things to keep in mind when choosing an online casino that will help you score big.</p>
<p>First and foremost, always do your research. Compare the bonuses and incentives offered by different online casinos before making a decision. Some casinos have sign-up bonuses which can be worth hundreds of dollars, while others offer loyalty programs which give players rewards such as cash back or complementary hotel stays.</p>
<p>Secondly, consider the variety of games offered by each casino. If you’re looking for a particular game - like blackjack or roulette - then make sure the casino you choose has a wide selection of variations on that game.</p>
<p>Finally, read reviews from other players to get an idea of what the casino is like in terms of customer service and gameplay. Casinos that have good reputations among players tend to be more reputable overall, so it’s worth taking the time to read some reviews before making your final decision.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to select a good online casino, let’s take a look at some specific tips for improving your odds at gambling games.</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular online casino games and also one of the easiest to beat if you know what you’re doing. Here are three tips for winning at blackjack:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always split aces and eights (unless the dealer has an ace). This is one of the most basic blackjack strategies and will increase your chances of winning significantly.</li>
<li>Stay away from insurance bets. These bets are sucker bets and should be avoided at all costs.</li>
<li>Use basic strategy charts to help you make decisions while playing. There are plenty of free charts available online, so print out a few before starting to play and refer to them as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Roulette is another popular casino game that can be beaten with a bit of strategy. Here are four tips for increasing your chances of winning at roulette:1) Choose an European wheel instead of an American wheel - the house edge on European wheels is only 2.7%, compared to 5.26% on American wheels.2) Stick to even-money bets like red&#x2F;black or odd&#x2F;even - these bets have the lowest house edge and therefore offer the best chance of winning over time.3) Avoid betting on single numbers - the odds are against you with this bet and it’s unlikely that you’ll win in the long run.4) Use betting systems like Fibonacci or Martingale to increase your chances of winning without risking too much money in the process.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s take a look at poker, which is one of the most popular gambling games around today. There are several different variations of poker, but we’ll focus on tournament play here since it’s where many people make their money playing poker online. Here are three tips for increasing your chances of success in online poker tournaments:1) Play tight early on - wait for good hands before putting any money into play. This will help you avoid losing too much money early on in the tournament and will enable you to make better decisions when it matters later on.2) Get reads on your opponents - watch them play and try to figure out their tendencies so you can exploit them later on in the tournament when it matters most .3) Use progressive betting systems like pot control or aggression adjusting to increase your profits over time without risking too much money at any given point</p>

<p>The commission ordered the machines closed on October 10 after it emerged that workers at the casino had been placing bets on them.</p>
<p>In a statement, the commission said it had found “a number of serious and systemic compliance issues” at the casino, including employees placing bets and “being able to influence or control the outcome of gaming activities”.</p>
<p>The closure order applied to all of the casino’s slots, but 12 were re-opened on October 18 after being deemed compliant with state regulations.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the casino said all of its other machines remained closed while it worked to address the commission’s concerns.</p>

<p>The casino closed its doors to the public on Aug. 25 to give its floor crew time to rip up the old carpet and install new hardwood flooring.</p>
<p>In addition to the new flooring, work was also done on the ceilings and walls in some areas of the casino.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited about it,” said casino spokeswoman Tracy Edwards. “It looks great and it’s really modernized the look of the casino floor.” </p>
<p>When the casino reopens Saturday, it will do so with a new player’s club card system that Edwards says is more user-friendly than the old one. The new cards were introduced earlier this week at three other casinos owned by Great Canadian Gaming Corp., which also operates River Rock Casino. </p>
<p>The other casinos are Baccarat Casino in Kamloops, Grand Villa Casino in Burnaby and Starlight Casino in New Westminster. </p>
<p>Edwards said there are already 10,000 players registered for the new cards at River Rock Casino and that number is expected to grow once the cardholders start using their cards at other Great Canadian Gaming Corp. casinos. </p>
<p>The first person to use their new card at any of Great Canadian Gaming Corp.’s casinos will get a $1,000 free play bonus, she said.</p>
