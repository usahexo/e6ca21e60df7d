<p>#How to Play Texas Holdem for Beginners<br>Texas hold’em is a variation of poker whose popularity surged after it was featured on the World Series of Poker (WSOP) television program. The following article outlines the rules for playing Texas hold’em as well as some helpful tips for beginners.<br>##The Basics<br>Texas hold’em is a two-player game where each player is dealt two cards face down (hole cards), followed by five community cards face up. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of hole cards and community cards.<br>Before any betting takes place, both players must use two hole cards to make one hand (e.g., if you are dealt an Ace and a King you could use either card as your Ace or King). After the first two cards have been dealt there is a “flop” (three community cards), then a “turn” (fourth community card), followed by a “river” (fifth and final community card). At this point there will be five community cards visible to all players - four face up plus your hidden hole card(s). Betting then begins clockwise from the player left of the dealer button who starts with a compulsory bet called the “small blind”. When all bets have been placed, each player remaining in turn then has two options: either “call” (match) the amount of the last bet; or “raise” (increase) it. In Cases where there has been no raise preflop, calling is mandatory if you want stay in play on subsequent streets; otherwise you may fold your hand at any time and forfeit any bets made thus far.. The game ends when both players run out of chips - at which point whoever has more chips is declared winner.<br>##How To Play </p>
<p>Now that you understand how Texas hold’em works, let’s take a look at how you can actually play the game: </p>
<ol>
<li>Choose your seat: Every poker table has certain spots which are better than others - these are typically referred to as “positions”. Most beginner players should avoid sitting in early positions (i.e., seats 1-3), as they have less control over what happens postflop than those who sit in later positions. </li>
<li>Place starting bets: The minimum bet at any given table will be specified before play begins, but during preflop betting rounds it’s customary for players to incrementally increase their bets by one unit each time - hence the term “betting round”. So if someone opens with a minimum bet of $10, then subsequent raises would be in increments of $10 i..e., $20, $30 etc..  3) Play your hand: If you decide to call or raise when it’s your turn, then put in enough chips equal to that amount; if you decide to fold then simply push your chips all-inwards towards the pottttt.. And that’s it! You’re now ready to play some Texas hold’em!</li>
</ol>
<p> ##Additional Tips For Beginners Here are some additional tips which should help beginners improve their chances of winning at Texas hold’em: </p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t forget about position : As mentioned earlier, position is extremely important in Texas hold’em - so always try and remember where you sit at the table in relation to everyone else. </li>
<li>Pay attention to betting patterns : By observing what your opponents are doing - both preflop and postflop - you’ll start gaining valuable information which can help inform future decisions made while playing poker hands against them. </li>
<li>Use pot odds : Pot odds are simply mathematical calculations used to determine whether or not it’s profitable enough</li>
</ol>
