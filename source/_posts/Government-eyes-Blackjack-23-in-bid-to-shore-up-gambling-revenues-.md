#  Government eyes Blackjack 23 in bid to shore up gambling revenues 

Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has announced that its new wide-body jet, the Blackjack 23, has been shortlisted for a government contract to supply up to 100 new airliners to help shore up flagging gambling revenues.

The Blackjack 23 was unveiled at last year’s Paris Air Show and is the latest in a long line of successful military jets from Boeing. The company is hopeful that its new civilian variant will be just as successful, with potential orders from both the private and public sector.

The Blackjack 23 is a state-of-the-art aircraft that can accommodate up to 300 passengers. It features the latest in advanced avionics and fuel-efficient engines, making it perfect for long-haul flights.

The government’s decision to consider the Blackjack 23 for its new gambling fleet is a major vote of confidence for Boeing. The company is already a leading supplier of military aircraft to the government, and this latest contract could see it cement its position as the premier supplier of civilian airliners too.

Boeing is keen to stress that the Blackjack 23 is not just a standard airliner, but has been specifically designed for the needs of the gambling industry. For example, it features an extensive gaming suite that will keep passengers entertained during long flights.

The Blackjack 23 is expected to enter service in 2021, and Boeing is confident that it will be a huge success in the gambling market.

#  Casino giant hits back at $8.5B gambling tax proposal 

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has come out swinging against an $8.5 billion proposed tax on the gambling industry in the U.S., calling the measure “punitive” and “counterproductive.”

The proposal, announced last week by House Democrats, would be levied on casinos, online gambling sites and sports betting operations in order to help fund a proposed infrastructure package.

Adelson, who is among the richest people in the world, said in a statement that the proposed tax would lead to job losses and put U.S. businesses at a disadvantage against those in other countries.

“This punitive and counterproductive proposal will not only cost jobs but also billions in economic output as this sector of our economy struggles to compete with foreign operators,” he said.

Adelson is well-known for his opposition to online gambling, which he has said is morally wrong and can lead to addiction problems. In 2012 he helped bankroll a successful effort to ban Internet gambling in the U.S.

Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International also came out against the proposed tax, saying it would hurt the competitiveness of U.S. casinos overseas.

#  Gambling industry cries foul over OECD's 'Blackjack 23' plan 

The gambling industry has come out swinging against a proposal by the OECD to prohibit casinos from using cards with more than 21 points.

In a statement, the gambling industry said that the proposal "has no basis in reality" and would "destroy thousands of jobs and deprive governments of much-needed revenue."

"This is a blatant attempt by the OECD to meddle in the affairs of sovereign nations," said the gambling industry spokesperson. "It's nothing but thinly veiled protectionism for their own industries."

The OECD has defended its proposal, saying that it is necessary to protect consumers from being exploited by casino operators.

"Our research shows that casinos use cards with higher point totals to increase their odds of winning," said an OECD spokesperson. "This is unfair and deceptive practice, and it needs to stop."

The gambling industry has accused the OECD of hypocrisy, pointing out that many of the member countries allow state-run lotteries which are far more exploitative than casino games.

"If the OECD is really interested in protecting consumers, then they should start by abolishing state-run lotteries," said the gambling industry spokesperson. "These lotteries are nothing but a tax on the poor, and they need to be stopped."

#  Canada set to implement new gambling tax regime with Blackjack 23 

As of July 1, 2019, the Canadian government will implement a new gambling tax regime. This change will see the removal of the existing two-tier system, which sees different rates of taxation for casino and online gambling. 

Under the new system, all forms of gambling will be taxed at the same rate: 28%. This is expected to raise up to an additional CAD $156 million in revenue each year. 

The government says that the move is being made to ensure a “level playing field” for both physical and online casinos. However, the industry is warning that it could lead to job losses and a reduction in investment. 

The new tax comes as part of Bill C-97, which was tabled in Parliament in February 2019. The bill includes a range of measures, including changes to the Canada Child Benefit and an increase in the minimum wage. 

It remains to be seen how the industry will respond to the new gambling tax regime. However, with just weeks until it comes into effect, it is likely that we will start seeing some major changes in the Canadian gaming landscape.

#  Are you ready for the new gambling tax regime?

The new gambling tax regime is coming into effect on 1 January 2019. The government has announced that a 15% point-of-consumption (POC) tax will be levied on all bets placed in Australia, regardless of the location of the operator.

This change will have a significant impact on the gambling industry and consumers alike. So, what do you need to know about the new tax?

What is the point-of-consumption tax?

The POC tax is a levy that is paid by the consumer on all bets placed in Australia. It applies regardless of the location of the operator, meaning that Australian companies will be taxed on bets placed by their customers, and offshore companies will also be taxed on bets placed by Australians.

How much will I have to pay?

The POC tax rate is set at 15%, which means that you will have to pay an additional 15% on top of your bet amount. For example, if you place a $100 bet, you will have to pay $115 in total (including the original bet amount and the POC tax).

When does it come into effect?

The new gambling tax regime comes into effect on 1 January 2019. This means that any bets placed from this date onwards will be subject to the POC tax. However, operators will have until 1 July 2019 to start collecting taxes from their customers.

What does this mean for consumers?

Consumers can expect to see an increase in gambling costs as a result of the new POC tax. In some cases, this may lead to a decrease in consumer spending and ultimately fewer betting options available. It’s important to remember that not all gambling providers are equal and some may choose to absorb the cost of the POC tax themselves, resulting in marginally higher prices for consumers. As such, it’s always important to shop around and compare prices before placing a wager.

What does this mean for operators?


Operators face significant changes with the introduction of the new POC tax. They are now required to register with Australian authorities and must collect and remit taxes from their customers. Failure to do so could result in hefty penalties or even prosecution. In addition, operators must ensure that they are compliant with Australian regulations when offering services to Australians – otherwise they could face fines or even lose their licence altogether.
