How do they achieve this?
One of the key reasons behind Barcelona’s success is their slot machine system. This system sees the likes of Messi, Neymar Jr., and Suarez rotate around one another in order to create space and confusion amongst the opposition defence. This attacking trio has been nicknamed ‘MSN’ and they have been responsible for some staggering statistics over the past few years. For instance, Messi has scored over 500 goals for Barcelona while Neymar Jr. has netted over 100 times. Suarez is not far behind with over 80 goals himself.

What system does Barcelona use?  

  FC Barcelona employs a 4-3-3 formation which allows them to maintain possession of the ball while also having enough firepower to score goals when needed. The midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic, and Andres Iniesta control the tempo of the game while also providing support to the attack. Meanwhile, Gerard Pique and Samuel Umtiti anchor the defence together with Jordi Alba providing width down the left flank.

#  Slot machine overhaul pays off for FC Barcelona as team dominates world of gambling

 Barcelona’s gamble to overhaul its slot machine strategy has paid dividends as the team has now become the dominant force in gambling.

The Spanish side completely reworked its approach to slot machines in the summer of 2017, and it has led to a remarkable increase in profits.

According to figures released by Spain’s National Gambling Board, Barcelona generated more than €126 million from slots in the 10 months between July 2017 and April 2018.

That is a staggering increase of nearly €60 million on what the club earned from slots in the previous 12-month period.

It is a clear indication that Barcelona’s new strategy is working, with players such as Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez leading the team to success both on and off the pitch.

The overhaul saw Barcelona move away from traditional one-armed bandits towards video slots, which have proven to be far more popular with punters.

That decision was prompted by a desire to tap into the lucrative Asian market, where video slots are hugely popular.

And it would appear that the strategy is paying off, with Barcelona’s fans across the world betting big on their team.
