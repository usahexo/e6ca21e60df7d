#  River Rock Casino Reopens Slot Machines After State Inspection 

A dozen slot machines at River Rock Casino have been re-opened after being closed down by the state gambling commission, according to a notice from the casino.

The commission ordered the machines closed on October 10 after it emerged that workers at the casino had been placing bets on them.

In a statement, the commission said it had found "a number of serious and systemic compliance issues" at the casino, including employees placing bets and "being able to influence or control the outcome of gaming activities".

The closure order applied to all of the casino's slots, but 12 were re-opened on October 18 after being deemed compliant with state regulations.

A spokeswoman for the casino said all of its other machines remained closed while it worked to address the commission's concerns.

#  River Rock Casino To Reopen Slot Machines Saturday Morning 

RIVER ROCK CASINO, Richmond BC – After a month-long closure for floor renovations, the casino’s 1,100 slot machines will reopen for business at 11 a.m. Saturday.

The casino closed its doors to the public on Aug. 25 to give its floor crew time to rip up the old carpet and install new hardwood flooring.

In addition to the new flooring, work was also done on the ceilings and walls in some areas of the casino.

“We’re really excited about it,” said casino spokeswoman Tracy Edwards. “It looks great and it’s really modernized the look of the casino floor.” 


When the casino reopens Saturday, it will do so with a new player’s club card system that Edwards says is more user-friendly than the old one. The new cards were introduced earlier this week at three other casinos owned by Great Canadian Gaming Corp., which also operates River Rock Casino. 

The other casinos are Baccarat Casino in Kamloops, Grand Villa Casino in Burnaby and Starlight Casino in New Westminster. 

Edwards said there are already 10,000 players registered for the new cards at River Rock Casino and that number is expected to grow once the cardholders start using their cards at other Great Canadian Gaming Corp. casinos. 

The first person to use their new card at any of Great Canadian Gaming Corp.'s casinos will get a $1,000 free play bonus, she said.
