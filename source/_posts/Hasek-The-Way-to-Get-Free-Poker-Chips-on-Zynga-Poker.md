#  Hasek: The Way to Get Free Poker Chips on Zynga Poker

If you are looking for a way to get free poker chips on Zynga Poker, then you should consider using the Hasek exploit. This exploit allows you to get an unlimited number of free poker chips without having to spend any money.

The first step is to create a new Facebook account and download the Zynga Poker app. Make sure that you use a different email address than your primary Facebook account. Once you have created the new Facebook account and downloaded the Zynga Poker app, open the app and click on the “settings” button.

Next, click on the “accounts” tab and then click on the “add account” button. Enter your primary Facebook email address and password and then click on the “sign in” button. If you have already played Zynga Poker on your primary Facebook account, then your game progress will be automatically transferred over to your new Facebook account.

Now that you have signed in with your primary Facebook account, all of your progress in Zynga Poker will be reset. This includes your chip balance, achievements, etc. Don’t worry though – all of your previous chips will still be available in your new account once you start playing again.

The next step is to start playing at a low stakes table and earn as many poker chips as possible. Once you have accumulated a few thousand poker chips, it’s time to take advantage of the Hasek exploit.

To do this, simply go to the main lobby screen and click on the “settings” button located in the top right corner of the screen. Next, scroll down until you see the section for “Hasek – Get Free Chips” and then click on the “enable” button. You should now see a new box at the bottom of the screen that says “Enter Your Code: _____”.

In this box, enter the following code: hasek_free_chip_code (make sure to remove the underscores). After entering the code, hit enter and wait for about 10 seconds for it to process. You should now see a message that says “You Have Activated The Hasek Hack! Enjoy Your Free Chips!” Congratulations – you have just successfully hacked Zynga Poker!
