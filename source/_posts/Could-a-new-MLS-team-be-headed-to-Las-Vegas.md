#  Could a new MLS team be headed to Las Vegas?

The MLS is a North American professional soccer league with 24 teams. The league is divided into two conferences - the Eastern Conference and Western Conference. The conference champions then compete in the MLS Cup Playoffs to determine the overall champion of the league.

The MLS has been expanding rapidly in recent years, with new franchises being added in Atlanta, Minnesota, Los Angeles, and Miami. There are now discussions of adding a new team to the league, and Las Vegas is reportedly the front runner for this new expansion team.

Las Vegas would be a great city for an MLS team. The city has a large population and is home to many passionate sports fans. The Las Vegas Strip also offers plenty of entertainment and tourism options that could attract fans from around the country.

If a new MLS team were to be added in Las Vegas, it would likely play its games at Sam Boyd Stadium. This stadium has a capacity of just over 36,000 and has hosted numerous sporting events and concerts over the years. It would need some upgrades to meet MLS standards, but it would be a great venue for a new team.

There is no official announcement yet on whether or not a new MLS team will be added in Las Vegas, but there is certainly plenty of interest in the idea. Stay tuned for updates on this potential expansion team!

#  LAFC set to debut in 2018 as newest MLS club

The Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) is set to debut in 2018 as the newest Major League Soccer (MLS) club. The team will be based in the heart of downtown Los Angeles and play its home games at the new 22,000-seat Banc of California Stadium.

The ownership group for LAFC is led by entrepreneur and American venture capitalist Henry Nguyen, Hollywood producer and philanthropist Casey Wasserman and former NBA executive Tom Penn. While the team has yet to name a head coach, LAFC has already announced several high-profile signings, including Mexican international Carlos Vela and U.S. national team player Benny Feilhaber.

LAFC is committed to fielding a competitive team from day one and plans to invest heavily in its academy system in order to develop local talent. The club also promises an exciting, vibrant supporters’ culture that will make its home at the new Banc of California Stadium.

With the addition of LAFC, MLS will have 23 teams competing for the league championship starting in 2018.

#  Toronto FC repeats as MLS Cup Champions

Toronto FC capped an historic season on Saturday night, becoming the first MLS club to repeat as MLS Cup Champions with a 2-0 victory over the Seattle Sounders.

Jozy Altidore and Sebastian Giovinco were once again the stars of the show, scoring the two goals that would give Toronto their record sixth championship.

“It was electric,” said Toronto captain Michael Bradley of the crowd at BMO Field. “I think this city and this stadium, for these moments it’s as good as there is in the world.”

For Altidore and Giovinco, both of whom are coming towards the end of their respective careers, winning back-to-back MLS Cups is a special accomplishment.

“To do it twice in my career is amazing,” said Altidore. “Hopefully we can make it three next year.”

Toronto got off to a strong start, with Giovinco drawing a penalty in the seventh minute that he then converted himself. The Italian forward has now scored in three consecutive MLS Cup Finals.

The Sounders created some chances but were unable to break through Toronto’s stout defense, which was anchored by goalkeeper Alexander Bono. Bono made five saves on the night to earn MVP honors.

With the victory, Toronto becomes just the second club in league history to win multiple championships (joining LA Galaxy). Manager Greg Vanney also becomes just the third coach in league history to win multiple titles (joining Bob Bradley and Dominic Kinnear).

#  Seattle Sounders win first MLS Cup

Seattle Sounders FC won the MLS Cup for the first time on Sunday, defeating Toronto FC 5-4 on penalties after a 0-0 draw in regulation.

The Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei was the hero of the shootout, making two saves as Seattle prevailed 5-4 on penalties.

Toronto FC took the lead in the shootout when Justin Morrow converted his spot-kick, but Sounders captain Clint Dempsey equalized and Frei made two superb saves to deny Michael Bradley and Morrow and give Seattle victory.

It was a heartbreaking loss for Toronto, who had come back from a 3-0 deficit in the second leg of their Eastern Conference semifinal against Columbus Crew SC to reach the final.

But it was a triumphant evening for Seattle, who had finished runner-up in 2014 and were looking to finally clinch their first MLS Cup title.

#  Atlanta United breaks league attendance record

Atlanta United set an MLS attendance record on Sunday, with 71,874 fans packing Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the team’s final match of the season. The turnout easily surpassed the previous mark of 66,316, set by Seattle Sounders FC in 2016.

The Atlanta faithful had plenty to cheer about on Sunday, as United claimed a 3-1 victory over Philadelphia Union to secure a spot in the MLS playoffs. The club will open its postseason campaign next weekend with a Knockout Round match against New York City FC.

Sunday’s match served as a farewell to several Atlanta United stars, including Miguel Almiron and Gonzalo Martinez. Almiron is headed to the English Premier League this winter, while Martinez is joining Club Atletico River Plate in Argentina.

The record attendance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium was just one more accomplishment for Atlanta United in 2018. The club also won the Supporters Shield – awarded to the team with the best regular season record – and finished second in the Eastern Conference standings.
