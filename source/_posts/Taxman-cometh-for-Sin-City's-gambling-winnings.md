#  Taxman cometh for Sin City's gambling winnings

After years of gambling in Las Vegas, Nevada lawmakers have decided it's time for their cut. Gambling winnings in the city will now be subject to state taxes, starting at 8%.

This new tax comes as a bit of a shock to casino-goers, as Nevada was one of only a handful of states that didn't tax gambling winnings. But with the state's budget in shambles, lawmakers are looking for any way to bring in more revenue.

The 8% tax will apply not just to casino jackpots, but also to money won from poker or blackjack tables, slot machines, and race track betting. It will also apply to winnings from out-of-state casinos, even if the gambler is not a resident of Nevada.

The new tax is expected to generate about $60 million per year for the state coffers. In addition to the 8% tax, there is also a federal income tax on gambling winnings, which can be as high as 39.6%.

Casino operators in Las Vegas are not happy about the new tax. They say it will drive customers to other destinations such as Atlantic City or Monte Carlo. They are also concerned about the impact on tourism, which accounts for more than one-third of Nevada's economy.

But some observers say that the days of free rides for Sin City's casinos may be coming to an end. The city has been relying too much on its gaming revenues, and officials are now looking for ways to shore up its budget.

#  Nevada casinos to withhold income taxes on gambling winnings

In a unanimous decision on Wednesday, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that casinos may withhold state income taxes from gambling winnings. The ruling overturned a lower court's decision from 2014 that said the withholding was unconstitutional.

The state's high court justices ruled that the Nevada Constitution's "abatement of taxes" clause applied only to property taxes and not to income taxes. Justice Michael Cherry, who authored the opinion, said the state Legislature has "the authority to enact laws imposing a tax on income derived from gambling."

The decision could have wide-reaching implications for the state's nearly $1 billion casino industry, as well as its nearly $8 billion in annual taxable gambling revenue. Under the ruling, casinos will now be allowed to withhold 3 percent of gambling winnings in order to cover state income taxes.

Gov. Brian Sandoval praised the ruling, saying it would provide "much-needed revenue" for Nevada's schools and other essential services. "Today’s decision by the Nevada Supreme Court is a victory for our students and for all Nevadans," he said in a statement.

Opponents of the withholding policy argue that it amounts to an unconstitutional taking of property without due process. They also claim that it unfairly targets low-income gamblers, who are more likely to have their winnings confiscated by casinos.

But supporters say the withholding policy is necessary to ensure that Nevada's taxpayers are fairly compensated for losses suffered by casinos. They also note that players can avoid paying taxes on their winnings by filing a tax return in advance and claiming a credit for any withheld amount.

#  Gambling winnings will now be taxed in Nevada

Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada signed a bill into law this week that will impose a tax on gambling winnings. The new law, which goes into effect on January 1st, 2019, will levy a tax of 6.75% on all winnings above $5,000.

This tax is in addition to the income tax that Nevada residents already pay on their gambling winnings. Governor Sandoval said that the new tax is necessary in order to help pay for important state programs, such as education and healthcare.

Opponents of the new law say that it will drive gamblers away from Nevada casinos and to casinos in other states. They argue that this will cost the state millions of dollars in revenue and lead to job losses in the casino industry.

Governor Sandoval dismissed these concerns, saying that the state has "the most competitive gaming environment in the country" and that people will continue to gamble in Nevada even with the new tax. He added that the new law is fair because it applies to all forms of gambling, not just casino games.

#  Winners at Las Vegas casinos to have tax withheld

The Internal Revenue Service has announced that it will require casinos in Las Vegas to withhold a percentage of gambling winnings for federal income tax purposes. The new rule, which is effective on January 1, 2019, will require casinos to withhold 24 percent of winnings above $5,000 for individuals and 28 percent for corporations.

"This change ensures that the tax obligation on gambling winnings is appropriately administered," said IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig in a statement. "It also helps to ensure that taxpayers report their gambling income accurately."

The withholding requirement will apply to all casino games, including slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and craps. It does not apply to lotteries or horse races. Winnings from bingo or keno are also not subject to withholding.

Individuals who have gaming winnings of more than $1,200 in a year are already required to report those winnings on their federal income tax return. The new withholding rule will increase the amount of information reported by casinos to the IRS and should make it easier for the agency to enforce taxes on gambling income.

#  Sin City casinos to start withholding taxes on gambling winnings

Due to a recent change in Nevada law, casinos in Sin City will now start withholding taxes on gambling winnings. The new law requires casinos to withhold 6.75% of all gambling winnings for state and federal taxes.

The change in the law was made in an effort to help the state budget, which has been struggling in recent years. Governor Brian Sandoval said that the change would bring in an additional $7 million in revenue for the state each year.

Casino officials said that they are hopeful that the new law will not dissuade people from gambling in Nevada. They added that the withholding amounts are generally not withheld on casino winnings over $5,000.

The change in the law comes as a bit of a surprise, as Nevada is often considered to be a tax-free haven for gambling winnings. In fact, many other states have laws that specifically exempt gambling winnings from taxation.

However, it is not clear whether or not the new law will survive a legal challenge. There is already some discussion among legal experts about whether or not the new law violates the Constitution’s prohibition against double taxation.
