#  Sweet Life 2 Game Employs Innovative Video Making Software

In the new life-simulator game "Sweet Life 2", players are tasked with managing the life of a digital character in order to help them achieve their dreams. To make the game more realistic, the developers used an innovative video making software which allows players to record themselves directly inside of the game.

The software, called "Octoshape Streaming" is a cloud-based service that allows for low latency streaming of high quality video. This was perfect for the Sweet Life 2 team because it allowed them to create a more immersive experience for players. Director of Development at SweetLife2 Ltd., Amir Lahav, had this to say about the technology:

"We looked for a technology that would let us create a truly lifelike world and after trying out Octoshape Streaming we were blown away by the results. We were able to record real-world footage directly inside the game and then compile it all into one seamless video."

The Octoshape Streaming software has been used in other popular games such as GTA V and Fallout 4, but SweetLife 2 is one of the first games to use it for character creation and development. This new approach gives players greater control over their character and makes the game more personal.
