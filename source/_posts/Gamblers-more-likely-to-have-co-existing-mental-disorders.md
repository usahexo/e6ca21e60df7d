#  Gamblers more likely to have co-existing mental disorders

Gambling disorder is characterised by persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behaviour. Problematic gambling behaviour is defined as gambling that causes harm or distress, including but not limited to, problems with financial stability, work, social life, mental health, and physical health.

Up to two-thirds of people with a gambling disorder also have a co-existing mental disorder. The most common co-existing mental disorders are mood disorders (e.g. depression), anxiety disorders (e.g. panic disorder), and substance use disorders (alcohol or drug abuse/addiction). Personality disorders are also common in people with gambling disorder.

People with a gambling disorder are more likely to experience psychiatric hospitalisations, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and criminal activity than people without a gambling disorder.

Gambling disorder can be treated with cognitive-behavioural therapy or medication. Treatment can help people stop or reduce their problematic gambling behaviour and improve their mental health symptoms.

Chumash Casino Resort, in Santa Barbara County, California, is partnering with the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) to provide resources for those who suffer from problem gambling and other comorbid disorders. The NCPG is a national organization that provides education and resources for those with problem gambling and other comorbid disorders.

#  Gambling addiction may be linked to other mental health conditions

Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem. It can have a devastating impact on people’s lives, both financially and mentally. New research has found that gambling addiction may be linked to other mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety.

People with gambling addiction are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety than those without an addiction. This is because gambling addiction can be very isolating. People who are addicted to gambling often feel like they can’t talk to anyone about their problem, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Depression and anxiety can also be caused by gambling addiction because of the financial stress that it can cause. Financial stress is one of the main causes of depression and anxiety. When someone is struggling with debt or money problems, it can lead to a lot of emotional stress. This stress can then cause symptoms of depression or anxiety.

If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available for people with gambling addiction, including therapy and support groups. It is important to get help if you are struggling with this type of addiction, as it can have a negative impact on your life.

#  Comorbid disorders often go hand in hand with problem gambling

Problem gambling is a serious mental health condition that can have severe consequences for the individual and their loved ones. However, it is often comorbid with other mental health disorders, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Some of the most common comorbid disorders include mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.

People with problem gambling are twice as likely to suffer from a mood disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder, and three times as likely to have an anxiety disorder. In fact, problem gambling can be considered an early warning sign for developing a more serious mental illness. This is why it is so important to seek treatment for problem gambling if you or someone you know is struggling with it.

Substance use disorders are also common in people with problem gambling. Studies have found that up to 60% of people with problem gambling also have a substance use disorder. This may be due to the fact that people with problem gambling are often looking for ways to cope with their emotional pain. Alcohol and drugs can provide short-term relief, but they ultimately only make the problems worse.

If you are experiencing any of these comorbid disorders along with your problem gambling, it is important to seek out specialist help. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating comorbid conditions, so it is important to find a treatment plan that works for you. With the right treatment, you can overcome all of your challenges and start living a healthier life.
