#  Nevada Leads the Nation in Legal Online Gambling

The state of Nevada has been a pioneer in legalized gambling throughout the years. This includes both land-based and online gambling. In fact, Nevada was the first state to legalize fully online gambling in 2013.

This commitment to gaming is evident in the state’s revenue from legal gambling. In 2017, Nevada raked in over $1.3 billion from gambling taxes and fees. This accounted for about 11% of the state’s total revenue. It is clear that legalized gambling is a key part of Nevada’s economy.

The success of online gambling in Nevada is largely due to the tight regulations that are in place. The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) oversees all aspects of gaming in the state, including online poker rooms and casinos. This ensures that players are protected and that the games are fair.

The NGCB also requires operators to have a physical presence in Nevada. This prevents offshore operators from taking advantage of Nevadans and helps ensure that all online gambling is legal and regulated.

Nevada’s strong regulations have helped make it the top market for online gambling in the United States. In fact, nearly 60% of all American online poker players are located in Nevada. This gives Nevada a significant advantage over other states when it comes to attracting online gamblers.

The success of online gambling in Nevada has also led to increased investment in the industry. Over the past few years, several new casino resorts have opened in Las Vegas, including Wynn Palace and The Park MGM Resort. These casinos offer high-quality experiences with top-notch amenities, helping to cement Las Vegas’s status as a global gaming destination.

Overall, Nevada has been very successful with its legalized online gambling industry. The tight regulations and strong commitment to gaming have made it a top market for players around the world. And with new casino resorts opening up all the time, there’s no sign of this trend slowing down anytime soon!

#  Connecticut Joins the Growing List of States Offering Online Gambling

_In a major development for the online gambling industry, Connecticut has become the latest state to offer regulated online casino and poker games._

The launch of the new platform comes after months of preparations and extensive negotiations between the state government and gaming operators. The new website offers a range of popular casino games such as blackjack, roulette and slots, as well as a number of poker variants.

Players must be over 21 years of age and physically located in Connecticut in order to gamble on the site. In order to protect players against fraud and underage gambling, the site employs a range of security features, including identity verification and age verification processes.
