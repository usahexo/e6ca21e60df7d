#  Washington Casinos Ramp Up Sports Betting Offerings

As the US Supreme Court readies to rule on a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide, casinos in Washington are getting ready for the influx of new customers that could come with it.

Murphy’s Law Casino in Tacoma has already installed new betting screens and is training employees on the nuances of sports betting. Meanwhile, Snoqualmie Casino is offering free $10 bets to anyone who opens a new account.

“If sports betting is legalized, we expect to see a large uptick in business,” said Murphy’s Law marketing director Kasey Kiehl. “We want to make sure our customers are comfortable with how to bet and what the different types of bets are.”

Legalized sports betting could be a boon for Washington casinos, which have seen declining revenues in recent years. In 2017, Washington casinos took in $1.3 billion in revenue, down from $1.6 billion in 2012.

If the Supreme Court rules in favor of legalizing sports betting, it would be up to each state to decide whether to allow it. Oregon and Idaho currently do not allow any form of sports betting, while Montana and Nevada only allow limited forms of it.

#  Washington Casinos Eyeing Expansion of Sports Betting

The anticipation of the Supreme Court decision in favor of sports betting is heating up in Washington. The news has stirred up casino owners and lawmakers alike who are looking to expand gambling in the state.

If the court rules in favor of New Jersey, which is fighting a ban on sports betting, it would open the door for other states to legalize sports gambling. That's good news for casino operators who see the potential for new revenue sources from an expanded gambling market.

"We're obviously watching the Supreme Court decision very closely," said David Ammons, a spokesman for the Washington state Lottery. "We're interested in anything that could help grow lottery sales."

Casino operators say they are prepared to expand their sports betting offerings if the court rules in favor of New Jersey. Chris Lipp, CEO of Great American Gaming, which operates Yakima's Chips Casino, said his company would immediately offer sports betting on site if allowed.

Lawmakers are also getting into the act, with some floating the idea of allowing online sports betting in addition to on-site gambling. Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, has introduced Senate Bill 6655 that would allow both options.

"Our tribal partners are really looking forward to it," Carlyle said of expanded gambling options. "They believe it will create jobs and be a great economic development engine."

Opposition to expanded gambling remains strong, however, with some groups arguing that it can lead to addiction and other social problems.

#  Washington Casinos Adding Sports Betting to Menu

Gambling supporters in the Evergreen State cheered this week when news broke that both tribal and private casinos in Washington are preparing to offer sports betting. If all goes as planned, this new form of gambling could be up and running by the time the NFL regular season kicks off in September.

This is great news for fans of sports betting, who have been limited to illegal bookmaking operations and a few state-sanctioned wagers on horse racing and NCAA games. Now they will be able to place bets on all sorts of sporting events, from the Super Bowl to the World Series to the Masters golf tournament.

The details are still being worked out, but it seems likely that sports betting will be offered at most if not all of Washington's 24 casinos. This includes tribal casinos like Tulalip Resort Casino and Snoqualmie Casino, as well as casino operated by Las Vegas giants like Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International.

There will likely be a variety of betting options available, including straight bets, point spreads, over/unders, and parlays. In addition, many casinos will offer in-game betting, which allows you to place wagers on individual plays or innings in a game.

One big question that remains is how much money casino operators can make from sports betting. The answer could depend on how the state decides to regulate the industry. In some states, such as Nevada, sports betting is taxed at a rate of 6.75%, while in others it is treated as an extension of traditional casino gaming and is not subject to any taxes.

Washington lawmakers have been grappling with this issue for years, but have yet to come up with a definitive answer. Whatever they decide, it is clear that casino operators see sports betting as an opportunity to bring in more revenue and attract new customers.

#  Washington Gambling Houses Widening Sports Betting Options

As the United States Supreme Court meets to discuss the legality of sports betting, Washington gambling houses are preparing for a surge in betting interest. If the high court rules in favor of gambling, as many expect they will, Washington casinos and race tracks could see a jump in business as people place wagers on their favorite teams.

While the specifics of how sports betting would be implemented are still being hashed out, industry insiders say that there is already significant interest in the newly legalized activity. "There's no question that if sports betting is legalized, we'll see increased visitation and spending at our casino," said Brian Las Vegas, spokesperson for Snoqualmie Casino.

Some lawmakers are pushing for a plank that would allow tribal casinos to offer sports betting as well, which could give a significant boost to those businesses. "The tribes have an advantage because they're already doing this illegally," said Rep. Chris Hurst (D-Enumclaw). "They've been doing it for years, so they know how to do it."

Others are more cautious about the potential for expanded gambling and its effects on society. "We just don't know enough about the potential negative impacts of widespread sports betting to greenlight it just yet," said Sen. Curtis King (R-Yakima), who is also chair of the Senate Gaming Commission.

Regardless of which side of the debate they fall on, most observers agree that if the Supreme Court rules in favor of gambling, gaming establishments across Washington will see a significant increase in business.

#  Washington Casinos Rolling Out New Sports Betting

Washington casinos are rolling out their new sports betting platforms this week, in time for the opening of the NFL season.

The legalization of sports betting in Washington has created a lot of excitement among casino operators and players alike. And with good reason – the state’s gaming industry is expected to bring in over $1 billion in revenue each year.

Several of Washington’s larger casinos have already installed their new sports betting terminals, while others are still working on getting them up and running. In addition to traditional sports betting, some casinos are also offering virtual reality (VR) Sports betting, which allows players to bet on sporting events using VR headsets.

The state’s tribal casinos were quick to jump on the sports betting bandwagon, and many of them have already installed full-blown sportsbooks. The Quinault Beach Resort and Casino, for example, has a 14,000 sq ft sportsbook that includes a full bar and grill.

Players can place bets on just about any sport imaginable, from football and basketball to cricket and horseracing. The minimum bet is usually $1, but can be higher at some casinos. And unlike in some other states, there’s no need to wait until the game is actually underway – players can bet on games days or weeks in advance.

So far, most of the action has been concentrated on football and basketball games. But with the start of the MLB playoffs just around the corner, we can expect to see even more action in the coming weeks.

There’s still some speculation about how recreational players will fare against the experienced pros at the blackjack tables. But one thing is for sure – with all these new sports betting options available, Washington casinos are sure to be a busy place this fall!
