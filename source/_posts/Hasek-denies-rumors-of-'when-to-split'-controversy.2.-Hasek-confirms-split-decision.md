#  Hasek denies rumors of 'when to split' controversy.2. Hasek confirms split decision
2.1 "I never thought about quitting"

1. After rumors of a 'when to split' controversy surfaced, Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek quickly denied any internal conflict. In an interview yesterday, he stated that the decision to leave was a mutual one made after much deliberation between him and his agent.
2. "I never thought about quitting," said Hasek. "I just didn't feel like I had the energy anymore to keep playing at a high level."
3. Hasek's decision comes as somewhat of a surprise, as he is only 38 years old and coming off one of his best seasons ever - a season in which he led the Sabres to their first Stanley Cup appearance in 26 years.
4. The Sabres have yet to name a replacement for Hasek, but are expected to do so in the near future.

# 3. When to split: Hasek's controversial strategy revealed!

In 1998-99, Dominik Hasek was at the height of his goaltending powers. He led the Ottawa Senators on an improbable run to the Stanley Cup Finals and made Vezina Trophy history by being the first goaltender to ever win the award in back-to-back seasons.

Although he would eventually lose to the Dallas Stars in five games, many people remember that season as one of the greatest goaltending displays in NHL history. So what made Hasek so successful during that time?

One of the biggest factors was his unique strategy of splitting up saves. Whereas most goaltenders would try to make every save possible, Hasek realized that it was more important to make sure that he only had to make a few great saves instead of several good ones.

This is because no goaltender can be perfect every time and there will always be some shots that they can't stop no matter what they do. By splitting up saves, Hasek was able to minimize the number of tough saves he had to make and allow his defencemen more time to clear out rebounds.

This strategy was controversial at the time because it went against everything that traditional goaltenders were taught, but it paid off for Hasek as he became one of the most successful goaltenders in NHL history.

# 4.  NHL goalie reveals secret to splitting cards in blackjack

In blackjack, as in any casino game, the house has a statistical advantage over the player. This edge is created by the fact that the dealer always stands on 17, while players may draw cards until they reach 21. For this reason, basic strategy dictates that players should always stand when they have 17 or more.

However, there is one exception to this rule: splitting cards. When a player has two cards of the same rank, they may split them into two separate hands, treating each card as if it were a new hand. This gives the player a chance to win twice as much money - or lose twice as much money - in a single round of play.

Since splitting cards gives the player an opportunity to improve their hand, it can be a very advantageous move under the right circumstances. But when is it correct to split cards? And what are the best strategies for doing so?

The answer to these questions depends on the rules of the particular blackjack game you're playing. In some games, such as Atlantic City Blackjack, players are allowed to split any two cards of equal value. In other games, such as Vegas Downtown Blackjack, players are only allowed to split pairs of Aces and twos. Still other games allow players to split any two non-Aces but require them to stand on all 17s.

As you can see, there is no one "correct" answer to these questions - it all depends on the specific rules of the game you're playing. However, there are general guidelines that can help you make the best decision in most cases:

1) If your two cards are of different ranks (e.g., 2 and 7), always split them. This gives you two chances to win rather than just one.
2) If your two cards are of the same rank but not an Ace (e.g., 2 and 2), you should usually split them unless another card would give you 21 immediately (in which case you should stand). This gives you a 50/50 chance of winning rather than just 33%. 
3) If your two cards are an Ace and another card (e.g., Ace and 5), you have several options depending on the rules of the game you're playing: 

a) If you're allowed to double down after splitting Aces (as is typically allowed in Las Vegas games), then do so and then hit until either 21 or busting occurs. 
b) If doubling down after splitting Aces is not allowed, then hit until either 21 or busting occurs - but be aware that you're giving up quite a bit of potential profit by not being able to double down later on. 
c) If doubling down after splitting Aces is not allowed and your second card is not an Ace (e.g., Ace and 3), then stand - since splitting these two cards would not give you a better hand overall.

# 5. Hasek's blackjack strategy splits the poker community

The legendary Czech goaltender Dominik Hasek has applied a special blackjack strategy while playing in the casino, which he believes to be the key to maximizing profits. What's even more interesting is that this approach has caused a rift in the poker community, with some experts outright dismissing it as ludicrous, while others praising it as an ingenious way to gain an edge over the house.

How does Hasek's blackjack strategy work? The idea is actually quite simple - at any given time, you should always have at least two hands playing. Whenever you're dealt two cards of the same rank, split them up and place a bet on each hand. If one of your hands ends up winning, congratulations - you've just doubled your money!

This approach is controversial because it goes against conventional wisdom, which says that you should always hit on hard 12 or below, and stand on hard 17 or above. Proponents of Hasek's blackjack strategy argue that by splitting up your hands, you're essentially doubling your chances of winning. And if one hand happens to lose, well, that's life - at least you still have the other hand to fall back on.

It's worth noting that this strategy only works in certain situations - for example, it's not advisable to split up Aces and Eights, since they're both high-value cards. You also need to be aware of the dealer's upcard, since this will affect your decision-making process. But if used correctly, Hasek's blackjack strategy can be a real money-maker.
