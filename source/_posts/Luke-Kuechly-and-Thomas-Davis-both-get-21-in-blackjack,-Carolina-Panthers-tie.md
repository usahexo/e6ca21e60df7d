Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis are both avid blackjack players. So much so that the Carolina Panthers staff had to limit their playing time in order to not affect their performance on the field. This week, the two linebackers went to the casino together and each had a stellar performance.

#  Kuechly, Davis show their card skills with double 21 in blackjack

In blackjack, players are dealt two cards. The player's goal is to achieve 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. Carolina Panthers linebackers Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis both achieved 21 in a recent game while playing blackjack with friends.

Kuechly was the first to reach 21, followed shortly thereafter by Davis. "We were both pretty happy," said Kuechly. "It was a lot of fun."

The Panthers teammates have been known to enjoy card games together in their free time. In fact, Kuechly is a regular at the poker tables in Charlotte and has won several tournaments. Davis is also no slouch when it comes to playing cards; he says he learned how to play blackjack from his grandfather.

While the two linebackers were able to achieve 21 in blackjack, they both acknowledged that it's not always easy to do so. "You've got to be careful," said Kuechly. "If you go over 21, you lose."

Davis added: "You can't get too aggressive. You have to make sure you know when to hit and when to stand."
