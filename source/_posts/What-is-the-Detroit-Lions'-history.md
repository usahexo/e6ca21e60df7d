#  What is the Detroit Lions' history?

The first Detroit Lions team was established in Portsmouth, OH in 1929 as a member of the "American Football League". The Portsmouth Spartans joined the National Football League (NFL) in 1930. In 1934, the Spartan's owner moved the team to Detroit and renamed them the Lions.

The Lions have won four NFL Championships: 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957. They also won the 1957 championship as part of the pre-Super Bowl era NFL playoffs. The Lions have played in the Super Bowl twice (1991 and 2009), but lost both games.

The Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit, Michigan. They are members of the National Football League (NFL) and play their home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit. The team was founded in 1929 as one of the inaugural members of the American Football League (AFL). They joined the NFL in 1930.

#  How did Major League Soccer start?

Major League Soccer (MLS) began in 1993 as a professional soccer league in the United States and Canada. It is sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) as the top-tier men’s professional soccer league in the country. The MLS operates as a single entity, which means that all teams are owned by the league and all player contracts are held by the league. This organizational structure was implemented in order to help keep costs down and improve the quality of play.

The first season of MLS had 10 teams: Atlanta United, Chicago Fire, Colorado Rapids, Columbus Crew SC, Dallas Burn, D.C. United, Kansas City Wizards, Los Angeles Galaxy, New England Revolution, and New York/New Jersey MetroStars. The inaugural season kicked off on April 6th, 1996 with D.C. United defeating the San Jose Clash at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C.

As the league has grown so has its popularity. In 2010 it was announced that MLS had agreed to a 3-year deal with ESPN and Fox Sports that would see games broadcast nationally in both English and Spanish across both networks. The agreement was extended for an additional 5 years in 2013 and is worth a reported $90 million per year. This exposure has helped to grow the league’s fan base both domestically and internationally.

There are now 24 teams competing in MLS with 2 more set to join in 2020 (Nashville SC and Miami FC). While there have been some organizations that have failed (e.g., Chivas USA), the overall growth of the league has been impressive.

So how did Major League Soccer start? In short, it was born out of a desire to create a top-tier professional soccer league in the United States and Canada. This article will provide a bit more detail on how MLS came to be and some of the challenges it has faced along the way.

#  Who are some of the most well-known players in Major League Soccer?

Each year, the MLS becomes more and more popular. The league now has 24 teams, and each team has several well-known players.

#  How has Major League Soccer grown since its inception?

When Major League Soccer was founded on April 6, 1995, there were 10 charter members: Columbus Crew, Colorado Rapids, Dallas Burn (now FC Dallas), Kansas City Wizards (now Sporting Kansas City), Los Angeles Galaxy, New England Revolution, New York/New Jersey MetroStars (now New York Red Bulls), Orlando City SC (formerly Miami Fusion), San Jose Earthquakes, and Tampa Bay Mutiny.

At the time of its founding, the league aimed to compete with both the National Football League and Major League Baseball as America's top professional sports leagues. To date, MLS has yet to overtake either of those leagues in terms of viewership or overall popularity. However, MLS has continued to grow in many ways since its inception.

One major way that MLS has grown is in terms of teams. As of the 2019 season, there are 24 teams in MLS. This is a significant increase from the 10 teams that were in the league at its founding. There have been a number of expansions over the years, with new teams being added in Atlanta (1996), Miami (1998), Los Angeles (2002), Dallas (2005), Houston (2006), Toronto (2007), Seattle (2009), Philadelphia (2010), Vancouver (2011), Portland (2011), and Montreal (2012).

In terms of attendance, MLS has also seen significant growth over the years. In the 1995 season, the average attendance for an MLS game was 17,416 fans per game. By contrast, the 2018 season saw an average attendance of 22,113 fans per game. This is a 28% increase in average attendance from when MLS first began.

Another way that MLS has grown is through its broadcasting agreements. In 1995, MLS signed a television deal with ESPN which gave them exclusive rights to broadcast games live. This deal lasted until 2002. Since then, MLS has signed several other broadcasting deals which have greatly increased the visibility of league games. These deals include agreements with Fox Sports (2002-2014), NBC Sports Group (2015-2022), Univision Deportes Network/Galavision/TUDN/Facebook Watch (2019-2025), and beIN SPORTS North America (2022-2025).

Lastly, MLS has also seen growth in terms of player salaries and team values. The average salary for an MLS player has increased from $92,000 in 2005 to $318,000 in 2019. Additionally, team values have been on the rise over the years. The average team value in 1998 was $6 million dollars. By contrast, the average team value for 2019 is estimated to be $223 million dollars. This is a 3600% increase in team values from when MLS first began!
