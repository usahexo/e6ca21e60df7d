#  Astros Secure First Place in West with 17-9 Win over Mariners

The Houston Astros secured first place in the west division of the MLB with a 17-9 win over the Seattle Mariners. The Astros were led by George Springer, who had four hits and six RBIs on the night. With the victory, the Astros are now one step closer to their first World Series appearance in franchise history.

The game was back-and-forth early, as both teams traded touchdowns in the first four innings. But the Astros slowly pulled away in the later innings, thanks in part to Springer’s big night at the plate. Springer had a three-run home run in the sixth inning to help extend Houston’s lead, and he later added an RBI double in the eighth inning to put the game out of reach.

Houston will now look ahead to their next series against the Texas Rangers. With just six games remaining in the regular season, it’s looking increasingly likely that the Astros will clinch their first divisional title in team history.

#  Angels muscle their way into 2nd place in the AL West

The Los Angeles Angels managed to take second place in the American League Western Division only a few games behind the Houston Astros. The Angels were able to do this with their strong lineup and bullpen performances.

The Angels’ acquisition of Justin Upton in the offseason bolstered their outfield and lineup. Upton hit .256 with 28 homers and 89 RBIs. He was also able to score 108 runs, which was third on the team. Other players in the lineup, such as Mike Trout and Andrelton Simmons, contributed to the team’s successes.

The bullpen was anchored by phenom reliever Blake Parker, who had a 2.54 ERA and saved 31 games. Along with Cam Bedrosian, Jim Johnson, and Joe Smith, they kept most opponents from scoring late in games.

Although the Angels did not make it to the World Series, they made great strides in being one of the better teams in baseball this year.

#  Rangers fall to 3rd in the AL West after 9-2 loss to Athletics

11 games back of the first-place Astros and 6.5 games behind the Mariners for the second AL Wild Card spot, the Rangers' playoff chances are dwindling.

Rougned Odor and Jurickson Profar each had solo home runs for Texas.

Athletics starter Sean Manaea struck out 11 in six innings, allowing only those two homers.

The Rangers have now lost five of their last six games and eight of their last 10.

#  Mariners move up to 4th in the AL West after defeating Astros

The Seattle Mariners have looked impressive in the early stages of the season, and that continued over the weekend with a dominating 7-1 victory over the Houston Astros. The Mariners are now up to fourth place in the AL West, just one game behind the division-leading Texas Rangers.

The Astros were the preseason favorites to win the division, but they have been off to a sluggish start this year. Houston has now fallen six games back of Texas in the AL West.

The Mariners got some big contributions from their starting pitchers over the weekend. Felix Hernandez was dominant against the Astros on Saturday, allowing just one run in eight innings of work. James Paxton was good on Sunday, allowing two runs in six innings.

Those two starters have been a big reason why Seattle is off to a hot start this season. Hernandez has a 2.38 ERA so far this year, while Paxton has a 3.00 ERA.

The offense has also been clicking for Seattle recently. Robinson Cano has been one of the hottest hitters in baseball lately, and he continued that trend over the weekend by going 7 for 14 with four RBIs. Nelson Cruz also had a big series against Houston, going 5 for 13 with three homers and six RBIs.

If Seattle can keep playing like this, they should be able to make a run at winning the AL West this year. The Rangers are still ahead of them, but there is plenty of time for Seattle to make up that ground.

#  Oakland Athletics take over last place in the AL West

The Oakland Athletics may have been in first place in the AL West just a few weeks ago, but they have taken over last place after a series of tough losses. In their latest game, they lost to the Rangers 16-10. This was their fourth consecutive loss and seventh in their past eight games.

The Athletics are now in last place in the division with a record of 36-42. They are also 9 1/2 games behind the first-place Astros. It is still early in the season, but the Athletics will need to start winning soon if they want to catch up to the rest of the teams in their division.

One of the team's biggest problems has been its inability to score runs. In their past eight games, they have scored only 28 runs. This is not nearly enough to win any games, especially against teams like the Rangers who can score a lot of runs themselves.

The good news for the Athletics is that they still have plenty of time to turn things around. They are only two games back of the Seattle Mariners for second place in the AL West. If they can start winning more games, they could easily move up in the standings before the end of the season.
