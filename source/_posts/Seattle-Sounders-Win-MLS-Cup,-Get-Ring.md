#  Toronto FC Crowned Champions in Dramatic Fashion

Toronto FC made MLS Cup history on Saturday, becoming the first team in league history to come back from a three-goal deficit in the final to win the title. The Reds capped an improbable championship run with a 5-4 victory over Seattle Sounders in front of a sold-out crowd of 67,361 at BMO Field.

Toronto FC was trailing 4-1 after 56 minutes but goals from Jozy Altidore, Michael Bradley and Sebastian Giovinco in a five-minute span brought them level. Victor Vazquez then scored the winning goal in the 114th minute, completing an incredible comeback for Toronto.

"I don't have the words," said TFC coach Greg Vanney. "You don't make plans for these types of things. It's just unbelievable."

The title is Toronto FC's first ever Major League Soccer championship and also makes them the first Canadian team to win the MLS Cup. The Reds had previously come up short in six previous appearances in the final, including last year's loss to Seattle Sounders.

Saturday's victory was also sweet revenge for Toronto FC, who were eliminated from this year's playoffs by Seattle Sounders. "We wanted to come out and punish them for what they did to us," said Altidore.

Toronto FC started brightly and took the lead in the ninth minute when Giovinco played a through ball to Altidore, who finished clinically past Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei. But Seattle responded with two goals in quick succession, as Clint Dempsey and Nicolas Lodeiro both found the net in the 23rd and 25th minutes.

It looked like Seattle would run away with the game but Toronto FC mounted a furious comeback in the second half. Bradley started it off with a well-placed shot into the top corner in the 59th minute, then Giovinco equalized with a free kick that deflected off defender Roman Torres and into the net.

The frenetic scoring continued as Vazquez fired home to give Toronto FC its first lead of the game in the 114th minute. The goal sparked wild celebrations among the Toronto fans, who had been backing their team passionately throughout an unforgettable match.

#  Atlanta United Clinch First-Ever MLS Cup berth

In front of a packed and raucous Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta United put the exclamation point on their first-ever MLS Cup playoff berth with a 3-1 victory over New York City FC Sunday.

Josef Martinez, Miguel Almiron and Ezequiel Barco scored for United, who dominated from start to finish against an NYCFC side that had nothing to play for except pride.

The win was especially sweet for Almiron and Barco, both of whom were making their first appearances since returning from lengthy injuries.

“We worked so hard this season and it’s really special to make the playoffs in our first year,” Almiron said. “We’re just starting now – we want to keep going and make even more history.”

Atlanta (21-7-6) will now host Columbus Crew SC in the Eastern Conference semifinal Thursday night. The Crew (16-11-7) upset top seed DC United 2-0 in their quarterfinal matchup Sunday.

It will be the first time Atlanta has hosted a playoff game in its short history. The club had never qualified for the postseason before this year.

#  LA Galaxy among Teams Headed to MLS Cup Playoffs

The LA Galaxy are among the teams that have qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. The playoffs got underway over the weekend, with 10 of the 11 teams in action. The only team that is not yet in the postseason is FC Dallas.

The Galaxy got off to a strong start, winning 3-1 against Vancouver Whitecaps. Giovani Dos Santos led the way for LA, scoring two goals in the match. That put him in third place on the all-time goal scoring list for LA, behind only Robbie Keane and Landon Donovan.

LA is now in fourth place in the Western Conference, but they are just two points out of first place. They will need to continue to play well if they want to make it to MLS Cup.

In the Eastern Conference, Toronto FC has already clinched a spot in the playoffs. They became the first Canadian team to ever make it to MLS Cup. Atlanta United is currently in first place in the East, although they could be passed by New York City FC if they win their match on Sunday night.

The playoffs will continue this weekend with four more games. The matchups are as follows: Seattle Sounders vs Colorado Rapids, Houston Dynamo vs Portland Timbers, Sporting Kansas City vs San Jose Earthquakes, and Columbus Crew SC vs Chicago Fire.

#  Historic Night for Sporting Kansas City as They Make Playoffs

Sporting Kansas City secured their place in the MLS Playoffs for the seventh consecutive year with a thrilling come-from-behind victory over Minnesota United.

In front of a sellout crowd at Children’s Mercy Park, Sporting KC overturned a two-goal deficit to win 3-2.

A stunning goal from Ike Opara in the 88th minute sealed the victory and moved Sporting KC up to fourth place in the Western Conference.

Manager Peter Vermes was delighted with the comeback win and praised his players for their resilience.

“It was a great game,” Vermes said. “There were some excellent performances out there, especially in the second half. We fought hard to get back into it and I thought we deserved to win in the end. It’s fantastic to make the playoffs again and we will be ready for whoever we play next.”

Sporting KC will now face off against either FC Dallas or Real Salt Lake in the Western Conference Knockout Round on October 31st.
