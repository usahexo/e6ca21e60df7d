#  What should I wear to stay up-to-date on current fashion and style trends?

There are a few things to consider when trying to stay up-to-date on fashion and style trends.  The first is to figure out which trends appeal to you. Do you prefer classic styles or are you more open to experimenting with new looks? Once you’ve identified your personal style, it will be easier to identify which current trends fit in with your overall look. 

Another thing to consider is your lifestyle and what activities you regularly participate in. Certain styles are better suited for certain lifestyles than others. If you have an active lifestyle, for example, you’ll want clothes that are comfortable and can withstand a lot of wear and tear. 

The final thing to think about when keeping up with fashion and style trends is your budget. It’s important to find clothes that fit both your style and your budget. There are plenty of affordable clothing options out there, so there’s no need to break the bank just to stay fashionable. 

With that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the most popular fashion and style trends for 2019:

1) Layering: layering is one of the most versatile styling techniques, and it’s still popular this year. You can layer pieces in a variety of ways, depending on the look you’re going for. For example, you can add a cardigan over a dress or shirt; layer different necklaces together; or mix and match prints and textures. 

2) Stripes: stripes are still popular this year, especially thin stripes. They can be dressed up or down depending on the other pieces you pair them with. For example, striped pants can be dressed up with a blazer and heels or dressed down with a T-shirt and sneakers. 

3) Florals: florals are always a popular print, but they’re especially big this year. You can find floral prints in everything from dresses to shirts to skirts. Just make sure that the scale of the print is flattering for your body type – large florals may be too overpowering for some people. 

4) Denim: denim has been around for decades and it’s still going strong this year. You can find denim in all sorts of styles – from jeans to skirts to jackets – so there’s something for everyone. Plus, denim is versatile so it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. 

5) Athleisure: athleisure has been growing in popularity over the past few years and it shows no signs of slowing down this year. Athleisure refers to clothes that can be worn both for exercising and for everyday activities like running errands or going out with friends. So if you’re looking for something comfortable and stylish that you can wear practically anywhere, athleisure is definitely worth considering.
